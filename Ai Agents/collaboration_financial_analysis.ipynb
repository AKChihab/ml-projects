It was created by Satoshi Nakamoto and the first block was mined on January 3, 2009. Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a blockchain, which is a distributed ledger that can be accessed by anyone to verify transactions. Transactions are verified by miners, who are rewarded with a set amount of Bitcoin and transaction fees. The supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins and it is divisible to eight decimal places. A wallet is needed to use Bitcoin and it consists of a public key, which is used to send and receive payments, and a private key, which is used to control the wallet. Bitcoin can be used for a variety of purposes, including everyday transactions, as a store of value, or for investment.What is Bitcoin?Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that uses cryptography to secure transactions and control the supply of new coins. It operates on a peer-to-peer network, where every transaction is recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. As the first digital currency to enable direct transfers of value without intermediaries, Bitcoin has pioneered a new approach to money. Today, it functions as both a medium of exchange and a store of value, influencing global finance and inspiring many other digital currencies.Each bitcoin is made up of 100 million satoshis, making it divisible up to eight decimal places. This means that anyone can purchase a fraction of a bitcoin with as little as one U.S. dollar.So, who created Bitcoin?That’s a question that has intrigued many. Bitcoin was created by an unknown person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2008, Satoshi published a whitepaper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” that outlined a method for sending money directly between individuals without relying on central authorities. The network came to life in January 2009 with the mining of the genesis block, marking Bitcoin’s official launch. Despite numerous investigations, Satoshi Nakamoto’s true identity remains a mystery.Then, who manages Bitcoin?How does Bitcoin work?How does Bitcoin mining work?What are Bitcoin Halvings?Why Does Bitcoin Appreciate in Value?Bitcoin (BTC) PriceWhat is Bitcoin’s All-Time High?How to Buy BitcoinHow is Bitcoin Stored?What is Bitcoin’s Energy Consumption?What is a Bitcoin ETF?How to Invest in a Bitcoin ETFAboutAbout UsMastheadCareersCoinDesk NewsCrypto API DocumentationContactContact UsAccessibilityAdvertiseSitemapSystem StatusDISCLOSURE & POLICESCoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

It was created by Satoshi Nakamoto and the first block was mined on January 3, 2009. Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a blockchain, which is a distributed ledger that can be accessed by anyone to verify transactions. Transactions are verified by miners, who are rewarded with a set amount of Bitcoin and transaction fees. The supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins and it is divisible to eight decimal places. A wallet is needed to use Bitcoin and it consists of a public key, which is used to send and receive payments, and a private key, which is used to control the wallet. Bitcoin can be used for a variety of purposes, including everyday transactions, as a store of value, or for investment.What is Bitcoin?Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that uses cryptography to secure transactions and control the supply of new coins. It operates on a peer-to-peer network, where every transaction is recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. As the first digital currency to enable direct transfers of value without intermediaries, Bitcoin has pioneered a new approach to money. Today, it functions as both a medium of exchange and a store of value, influencing global finance and inspiring many other digital currencies.Each bitcoin is made up of 100 million satoshis, making it divisible up to eight decimal places. This means that anyone can purchase a fraction of a bitcoin with as little as one U.S. dollar.So, who created Bitcoin?That’s a question that has intrigued many. Bitcoin was created by an unknown person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2008, Satoshi published a whitepaper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” that outlined a method for sending money directly between individuals without relying on central authorities. The network came to life in January 2009 with the mining of the genesis block, marking Bitcoin’s official launch. Despite numerous investigations, Satoshi Nakamoto’s true identity remains a mystery.Then, who manages Bitcoin?How does Bitcoin work?How does Bitcoin mining work?What are Bitcoin Halvings?Why Does Bitcoin Appreciate in Value?Bitcoin (BTC) PriceWhat is Bitcoin’s All-Time High?How to Buy BitcoinHow is Bitcoin Stored?What is Bitcoin’s Energy Consumption?What is a Bitcoin ETF?How to Invest in a Bitcoin ETFAboutAbout UsMastheadCareersCoinDesk NewsCrypto API DocumentationContactContact UsAccessibilityAdvertiseSitemapSystem StatusDISCLOSURE & POLICESCoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

      " Key Takeaways\n",
      "Bitcoin is the end product of the work of many people, but it is generally accepted that Satoshi Nakamoto created it and introduced it in 2008.Bitcoin is the public blockchain used to create and manage the cryptocurrency of the same name.Bitcoin mining is the race between miners to hash block information, find the solution to a hashing problem, and add a block to the blockchain. The winning miner is rewarded with bitcoins.Bitcoin can be used by speculators, investors for investing purposes, and consumers for purchases or value exchange.There are many risks involved with investing in and using bitcoins, including volatility, fraud, and theft.\n",
      " Investopedia / Julie Bang\n",
      " Understanding Bitcoin In August 2008, the domain name Bitcoin.org was registered. It was created by Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti Malmi, who worked with the anonymous Nakamoto to develop Bitcoin.\n",
      " How Bitcoin Started In October 2008, Nakamoto announced to the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com: \"I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.\" The now-famous white paper published on Bitcoin.org, entitled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" would become the Magna Carta for how Bitcoin operates today.\n",
      " First Block On Jan. 3, 2009, the first Bitcoin block was mined. Called Block 0, it is also known as the genesis block and contains the text: \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,\" perhaps proof that the block was mined on or after that date.\n",
      " Rewards Bitcoin rewards are halved every 210,000 blocks. For example, the block reward was 50 new bitcoins in 2009. On May 11, 2020, the third halving occurred, bringing the reward for each block down to 6.25 bitcoins. The fourth halving occurred in April 2024 and lowered the reward to 3.125 bitcoins. The next halving should happen in mid-2028 and reduce the reward to 1.5625 BTC.\n",
      " Denominations One bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places (100 millionths of one bitcoin), and this smallest unit is referred to as a satoshi.\n",
      " Important\n",
      "On Jan. 8, 2009, the first version of the Bitcoin software was announced to the Cryptography Mailing List, and on Jan. 9, 2009, Block 1 was mined, and Bitcoin mining began.\n",
      " Bitcoin's Blockchain Technology Bitcoin as a form of digital currency isn't hard to understand. For example, if you own a bitcoin, you can use your cryptocurrency wallet to send smaller portions of that bitcoin as payment for goods or services. By contrast, the way Bitcoin actually works is very complex.\n",
      " Blockchain A blockchain is a distributed ledger, a shared database of information that is chained together via cryptographic techniques. \"Distributed\" means that it is stored on many computers rather than a centralized server location, as is typical of most data storage.\n",
      " A network of automated programs installed on these computers maintains the blockchain and performs the functions necessary for it to operate.\n",
      " A block on a blockchain is a file that contains a block header, transaction counter, and the transactions recorded in the block. The transaction counter lists the transactions in the block, while the block header is made up of several elements:\n",
      "Software version: Which version the blockchain is running (sometimes called the magic number)\n",
      "Previous block hash: The encrypted information from the previous block\n",
      "Merkle root: A single hash (encrypted information) that contains all the hashed information from previous transactions\n",
      "Timestamp: The date and time the block was opened\n",
      "Difficulty target: The current network difficulty problem miners are attempting to solve for\n",
      "Nonce: Short for \"number used once,\" which is used to solve the mining problem and open the block.\n",
      " As noted, each block contains the hashed information of the previous block. This creates a chain of encrypted blocks (files) that contain information from all previous blocks, going back to the first block of the blockchain.\n",
      " Encryption Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to encrypt (hash) the data stored in the blocks on the blockchain. Simply put, transaction data stored in a block is encrypted into a 256-bit (64-digit) hexadecimal number. That number contains all the transaction data and information linked to the blocks before that block.\n",
      " Fast Fact\n",
      "While the data in a block is encrypted and used in the next block, the block is not inaccessible or non-readable. The hash is used in the next block, then its hash is used in the next, and so on, but all blocks can be read. This ensures that blocks cannot be changed without changing all other blocks and ensures anyone can audit the blockchain.\n",
      " How To Buy Bitcoin If you don't want to mine Bitcoin, you can buy it using a cryptocurrency exchange. Most people will be unable to purchase an entire BTC because of its price, but you can buy portions of one BTC on these exchanges in fiat currency, such as U.S. dollars.\n",
      " For example, you can buy a bitcoin on Coinbase by creating and funding an account using your bank account, credit card, or debit card. The following video explains more about buying a bitcoin.\n",
      "How to Buy Bitcoin\n",
      " How To Mine Bitcoin A variety of hardware and software can be used to mine Bitcoin. When the Bitcoin blockchain was first released, it was possible to mine it competitively on a personal computer. However, as it became more popular, more miners joined the network, which lowered the chances of being the one to solve the hash.\n",
      " You can still use your personal computer as a miner if it has newer hardware, but the chances of solving a hash individually using a home computer are minuscule.\n",
      " This is because you're competing with a network of miners that generate around 745 quintillion hashes (as of Dec. 5, 2024) per second. Machines—called Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built specifically for mining—can generate more than 400 trillion hashes per second. In contrast, a computer with the latest hardware hashes around 100 megahashes per second (100 million).\n",
      " Options for Successful Mining There are two hardware options available for Bitcoin mining and several software options.\n",
      " 1. You can use your existing computer and mining software compatible with Bitcoin software and join a mining pool. Mining pools are groups of miners that combine their computational power to compete with large ASIC mining farms.\n",
      " There are many mining programs to choose from and pools you can join. Two of the most well-known programs are CGMiner and BFGMiner. Some of the most popular pools are Foundry Digital, Antpool, F2Pool, ViaBTC, and Binance.com.\n",
      " 2. If you have the financial means, you could purchase an ASIC miner. You can generally find a new one for around $10,000, but used ones are also sold by miners as they upgrade their systems. There are some significant costs, such as electricity and cooling, to consider if you purchase one or more ASICs. Keep in mind using one or two ASICs is still no guarantee of rewards as you're competing with businesses with large mining farms of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of ASICs. For example, Bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark claims to have 195,059 miners deployed.\n",
      " Tip\n",
      "You can increase your chances of being rewarded bitcoins by joining a pool, but rewards are significantly decreased because they are shared. When choosing a pool, it's important to make sure to find out how it pays out rewards, what any fees might be, and to read some mining pool reviews.\n",
      " How To Use Bitcoin Bitcoin was initially designed and released as a peer-to-peer payment method. However, its use cases are growing due to its increasing value, competition from other blockchains and cryptocurrencies, and developments on blockchains that process information for the Bitcoin blockchain.\n",
      " Payment Bitcoin is accepted as a means of payment for goods and services at many merchants, retailers, and stores.\n",
      " Brick-and-mortar stores that accept cryptocurrencies will generally display a sign that says \"Bitcoin Accepted Here.\" The transactions can be handled with the requisite hardware terminal or wallet address through QR codes and touchscreen apps. An online business can easily accept bitcoin by adding this payment option to its other online payment options: credit cards, PayPal, etc.\n",
      " To use your bitcoin, you need to have a cryptocurrency wallet. Wallets are your blockchain interface and can hold the private keys to the bitcoins that you own. These keys must be entered when you're conducting a transaction.\n",
      " Investing and Speculating Investors and speculators became interested in Bitcoin as it grew in popularity. Between 2009 and 2017, cryptocurrency exchanges emerged that facilitated Bitcoin sales and purchases. Prices began to rise, and demand slowly grew until 2017, when its price broke $1,000.\n",
      " Many people believed Bitcoin prices would keep climbing and began buying it as long-term investments. Traders began using cryptocurrency exchanges to make short-term trades, and the market took off.\n",
      " After reaching about $69,000 in November 2021, Bitcoin's price crashed in 2022. In March 2022, it was as high as $47,454, but by November, it was $15,731. It then recovered in 2023, seeing a price as high as $31,474 before dropping back below $30,000.\n",
      " In early 2024, Bitcoin's price jumped into the mid $40,000s as expectations grew for Bitcoin Spot ETFs' approval. By mid-February 2024, after the ETFs were approved, Bitcoin's price climbed to more than $50,000.\n",
      " Important\n",
      "Following an increase in optimism and price after Donald Trump was re-elected in November 2024, Bitcoin breached $100,000 for the first time on Dec. 5, 2024, after years of arguments for and against its ability to do so by investors and analysts.\n",
      " Bitcoin prices tend to follow stock market trends because Bitcoin is treated the same way that investors treat other investments. However, Bitcoin price movements are greatly exaggerated and sometimes are prone to movements of thousands of dollars. Many Bitcoin investors tend to \"trade the news,\" as demonstrated by the fluctuations that occur whenever there is a significant news event.\n",
      " Risks of Investing in Bitcoin Bitcoin had a price of $7,167.52 on Dec. 31, 2019, and a year later, it had appreciated more than 300% to $28,984.98. It continued to surge in the first half of 2021, trading at a record high of $69,000 in November 2021. It then fell over the next few months to hover around $40,000 and rose with increasing speed in 2024 to more than $100,000.\n",
      " As a result of such price movements, many people purchase Bitcoin for its investment value rather than its ability to act as a medium of exchange. However, the lack of guaranteed value and its digital nature means its purchase and use carry several inherent risks.\n",
      " In fact, many investor alerts issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) concern Bitcoin investing.\n",
      " Here are some of the risks that you're exposed to when trading or investing in Bitcoin:\n",
      "Regulatory risk: The continuous battle between cryptocurrency-related projects and regulators makes longevity and liquidity an unknown. As of December 2024, Bitcoin is not considered a security by the authorities, but that stance could change in the future.\n",
      "Security risk: Most individuals who own and use Bitcoin have not acquired their tokens through mining operations. Rather, they buy and sell Bitcoin and other digital currencies on popular cryptocurrency exchanges. These exchanges are entirely digital and are at risk from hackers, malware, and operational glitches.\n",
      "Insurance risk: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). However, some exchanges provide insurance through third parties. For instance, Gemini and Coinbase offer cryptocurrency insurance, but only for failures in their systems or cybersecurity breaches. Any cash deposits you've made at either exchange might be eligible for \"pass-through\" FDIC coverage.\n",
      "Fraud risk: Even with the security measures inherent within a blockchain, there are still opportunities for fraudulent activity.\n",
      "Market risk: As with any investment, Bitcoin values can fluctuate. Indeed, the currency's value has seen wild price swings over its short existence. Subject to high volume buying and selling on exchanges, it is highly sensitive to any news events related to it.\n",
      " Regulating Bitcoin As with any new technology, it has been difficult to regulate Bitcoin. The U.S. administration seeks to impose regulations on cryptocurrency but, at the same time, walks a tightrope in trying not to throttle a growing and economically beneficial industry.\n",
      " Enforcement agencies in the U.S. continue to rely on existing securities, commodities, and tax laws, but as of December 2024, no attempts from legislators have gained much attention from the country's law-making bodies.\n",
      " The European Commission's long-anticipated Markets in Crypto Assets legislation came into force in 2023, setting the stage for cryptocurrency regulations in the European Union.\n",
      " India banned several exchanges in December 2023 and continues to push back reviews of any legislation regarding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n",
      " What Exactly Is Bitcoin and How Does It Work?\n",
      "Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency. It uses blockchain, which is a distributed ledger secured by cryptographic techniques.\n",
      " What Happens If You Invest $100 in Bitcoin Today?\n",
      "Investing in Bitcoin is very risky, but there is also the possibility of high returns. Prices can move by thousands of dollars per day, and long-term outlooks for the cryptocurrency vary.\n",
      " Can You Convert Bitcoin Into Cash?\n",
      "Yes. Bitcoin is a convertible currency that can be exchanged for most fiat currencies.\n",
      " How Much Is $1 Bitcoin in US Dollars?\n",
      "An amount of Bitcoin worth $1 is worth $1 in U.S. dollars. The value of 1 BTC in U.S. dollars varies by the minute, but on Dec. 5, 2024, it was more than $100,000.\n",
      " The Bottom Line Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency introduced to the public and was intended to be used as a form of payment outside of legal tender. Since its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin's popularity has surged, and its blockchain uses have expanded.\n",
      " Though the process of generating Bitcoin is complex, investing in it is more straightforward. Investors and speculators can buy and sell Bitcoin on crypto exchanges. As with any investment, particularly one as new and volatile as Bitcoin, investors should carefully consider if Bitcoin is the right investment for them.\n",

      " How Much of the World's Money is in Bitcoin?\n",
      " What Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency (a virtual currency) designed to act as money and a form of payment outside the control of any one person, group, or entity. This removes the need for trusted third-party involvement (e.g., a mint or bank) in financial transactions.\n",
      " Bitcoin was introduced to the public in 2008 by an anonymous developer or group of developers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It has since become the most well-known and largest cryptocurrency in the world. Its popularity has inspired the development of many other cryptocurrencies.\n",
      " Read on to learn more about the cryptocurrency that started it all—the history behind it, how to buy it, mine it, and what it can be used for.\n",
      " Key Takeaways\n",
      "Bitcoin is the end product of the work of many people, but it is generally accepted that Satoshi Nakamoto created it and introduced it in 2008.Bitcoin is the public blockchain used to create and manage the cryptocurrency of the same name.Bitcoin mining is the race between miners to hash block information, find the solution to a hashing problem, and add a block to the blockchain. The winning miner is rewarded with bitcoins.Bitcoin can be used by speculators, investors for investing purposes, and consumers for purchases or value exchange.There are many risks involved with investing in and using bitcoins, including volatility, fraud, and theft.\n",
      " Investopedia / Julie Bang\n",
      " Understanding Bitcoin In August 2008, the domain name Bitcoin.org was registered. It was created by Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti Malmi, who worked with the anonymous Nakamoto to develop Bitcoin.\n",
      " How Bitcoin Started In October 2008, Nakamoto announced to the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com: \"I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.\" The now-famous white paper published on Bitcoin.org, entitled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" would become the Magna Carta for how Bitcoin operates today.\n",
      " First Block On Jan. 3, 2009, the first Bitcoin block was mined. Called Block 0, it is also known as the genesis block and contains the text: \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,\" perhaps proof that the block was mined on or after that date.\n",
      " Rewards Bitcoin rewards are halved every 210,000 blocks. For example, the block reward was 50 new bitcoins in 2009. On May 11, 2020, the third halving occurred, bringing the reward for each block down to 6.25 bitcoins. The fourth halving occurred in April 2024 and lowered the reward to 3.125 bitcoins. The next halving should happen in mid-2028 and reduce the reward to 1.5625 BTC.\n",
      " Denominations One bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places (100 millionths of one bitcoin), and this smallest unit is referred to as a satoshi.\n",
      " Important\n",
      "On Jan. 8, 2009, the first version of the Bitcoin software was announced to the Cryptography Mailing List, and on Jan. 9, 2009, Block 1 was mined, and Bitcoin mining began.\n",
      " Bitcoin's Blockchain Technology Bitcoin as a form of digital currency isn't hard to understand. For example, if you own a bitcoin, you can use your cryptocurrency wallet to send smaller portions of that bitcoin as payment for goods or services. By contrast, the way Bitcoin actually works is very complex.\n",
      " Blockchain A blockchain is a distributed ledger, a shared database of information that is chained together via cryptographic techniques. \"Distributed\" means that it is stored on many computers rather than a centralized server location, as is typical of most data storage.\n",
      " A network of automated programs installed on these computers maintains the blockchain and performs the functions necessary for it to operate.\n",
      " A block on a blockchain is a file that contains a block header, transaction counter, and the transactions recorded in the block. The transaction counter lists the transactions in the block, while the block header is made up of several elements:\n",
      "Software version: Which version the blockchain is running (sometimes called the magic number)\n",
      "Previous block hash: The encrypted information from the previous block\n",
      "Merkle root: A single hash (encrypted information) that contains all the hashed information from previous transactions\n",
      "Timestamp: The date and time the block was opened\n",
      "Difficulty target: The current network difficulty problem miners are attempting to solve for\n",
      "Nonce: Short for \"number used once,\" which is used to solve the mining problem and open the block.\n",
      " As noted, each block contains the hashed information of the previous block. This creates a chain of encrypted blocks (files) that contain information from all previous blocks, going back to the first block of the blockchain.\n",
      " Encryption Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to encrypt (hash) the data stored in the blocks on the blockchain. Simply put, transaction data stored in a block is encrypted into a 256-bit (64-digit) hexadecimal number. That number contains all the transaction data and information linked to the blocks before that block.\n",
      " Fast Fact\n",
      "While the data in a block is encrypted and used in the next block, the block is not inaccessible or non-readable. The hash is used in the next block, then its hash is used in the next, and so on, but all blocks can be read. This ensures that blocks cannot be changed without changing all other blocks and ensures anyone can audit the blockchain.\n",
      " How To Buy Bitcoin If you don't want to mine Bitcoin, you can buy it using a cryptocurrency exchange. Most people will be unable to purchase an entire BTC because of its price, but you can buy portions of one BTC on these exchanges in fiat currency, such as U.S. dollars.\n",
      " For example, you can buy a bitcoin on Coinbase by creating and funding an account using your bank account, credit card, or debit card. The following video explains more about buying a bitcoin.\n",
      "How to Buy Bitcoin\n",
      " How To Mine Bitcoin A variety of hardware and software can be used to mine Bitcoin. When the Bitcoin blockchain was first released, it was possible to mine it competitively on a personal computer. However, as it became more popular, more miners joined the network, which lowered the chances of being the one to solve the hash.\n",
      " You can still use your personal computer as a miner if it has newer hardware, but the chances of solving a hash individually using a home computer are minuscule.\n",
      " This is because you're competing with a network of miners that generate around 745 quintillion hashes (as of Dec. 5, 2024) per second. Machines—called Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built specifically for mining—can generate more than 400 trillion hashes per second. In contrast, a computer with the latest hardware hashes around 100 megahashes per second (100 million).\n",
      " Options for Successful Mining There are two hardware options available for Bitcoin mining and several software options.\n",
      " 1. You can use your existing computer and mining software compatible with Bitcoin software and join a mining pool. Mining pools are groups of miners that combine their computational power to compete with large ASIC mining farms.\n",
      " There are many mining programs to choose from and pools you can join. Two of the most well-known programs are CGMiner and BFGMiner. Some of the most popular pools are Foundry Digital, Antpool, F2Pool, ViaBTC, and Binance.com.\n",
      " 2. If you have the financial means, you could purchase an ASIC miner. You can generally find a new one for around $10,000, but used ones are also sold by miners as they upgrade their systems. There are some significant costs, such as electricity and cooling, to consider if you purchase one or more ASICs. Keep in mind using one or two ASICs is still no guarantee of rewards as you're competing with businesses with large mining farms of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of ASICs. For example, Bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark claims to have 195,059 miners deployed.\n",
      " Tip\n",
      "You can increase your chances of being rewarded bitcoins by joining a pool, but rewards are significantly decreased because they are shared. When choosing a pool, it's important to make sure to find out how it pays out rewards, what any fees might be, and to read some mining pool reviews.\n",
      " How To Use Bitcoin Bitcoin was initially designed and released as a peer-to-peer payment method. However, its use cases are growing due to its increasing value, competition from other blockchains and cryptocurrencies, and developments on blockchains that process information for the Bitcoin blockchain.\n",
      " Payment Bitcoin is accepted as a means of payment for goods and services at many merchants, retailers, and stores.\n",
      " Brick-and-mortar stores that accept cryptocurrencies will generally display a sign that says \"Bitcoin Accepted Here.\" The transactions can be handled with the requisite hardware terminal or wallet address through QR codes and touchscreen apps. An online business can easily accept bitcoin by adding this payment option to its other online payment options: credit cards, PayPal, etc.\n",
      " To use your bitcoin, you need to have a cryptocurrency wallet. Wallets are your blockchain interface and can hold the private keys to the bitcoins that you own. These keys must be entered when you're conducting a transaction.\n",
      " Investing and Speculating Investors and speculators became interested in Bitcoin as it grew in popularity. Between 2009 and 2017, cryptocurrency exchanges emerged that facilitated Bitcoin sales and purchases. Prices began to rise, and demand slowly grew until 2017, when its price broke $1,000.\n",
      " Many people believed Bitcoin prices would keep climbing and began buying it as long-term investments. Traders began using cryptocurrency exchanges to make short-term trades, and the market took off.\n",
      " After reaching about $69,000 in November 2021, Bitcoin's price crashed in 2022. In March 2022, it was as high as $47,454, but by November, it was $15,731. It then recovered in 2023, seeing a price as high as $31,474 before dropping back below $30,000.\n",
      " In early 2024, Bitcoin's price jumped into the mid $40,000s as expectations grew for Bitcoin Spot ETFs' approval. By mid-February 2024, after the ETFs were approved, Bitcoin's price climbed to more than $50,000.\n",
      " Important\n",
      "Following an increase in optimism and price after Donald Trump was re-elected in November 2024, Bitcoin breached $100,000 for the first time on Dec. 5, 2024, after years of arguments for and against its ability to do so by investors and analysts.\n",
      " Bitcoin prices tend to follow stock market trends because Bitcoin is treated the same way that investors treat other investments. However, Bitcoin price movements are greatly exaggerated and sometimes are prone to movements of thousands of dollars. Many Bitcoin investors tend to \"trade the news,\" as demonstrated by the fluctuations that occur whenever there is a significant news event.\n",
      " Risks of Investing in Bitcoin Bitcoin had a price of $7,167.52 on Dec. 31, 2019, and a year later, it had appreciated more than 300% to $28,984.98. It continued to surge in the first half of 2021, trading at a record high of $69,000 in November 2021. It then fell over the next few months to hover around $40,000 and rose with increasing speed in 2024 to more than $100,000.\n",
      " As a result of such price movements, many people purchase Bitcoin for its investment value rather than its ability to act as a medium of exchange. However, the lack of guaranteed value and its digital nature means its purchase and use carry several inherent risks.\n",
      " In fact, many investor alerts issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) concern Bitcoin investing.\n",
      " Here are some of the risks that you're exposed to when trading or investing in Bitcoin:\n",
      "Regulatory risk: The continuous battle between cryptocurrency-related projects and regulators makes longevity and liquidity an unknown. As of December 2024, Bitcoin is not considered a security by the authorities, but that stance could change in the future.\n",
      "Security risk: Most individuals who own and use Bitcoin have not acquired their tokens through mining operations. Rather, they buy and sell Bitcoin and other digital currencies on popular cryptocurrency exchanges. These exchanges are entirely digital and are at risk from hackers, malware, and operational glitches.\n",
      "Insurance risk: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). However, some exchanges provide insurance through third parties. For instance, Gemini and Coinbase offer cryptocurrency insurance, but only for failures in their systems or cybersecurity breaches. Any cash deposits you've made at either exchange might be eligible for \"pass-through\" FDIC coverage.\n",
      "Fraud risk: Even with the security measures inherent within a blockchain, there are still opportunities for fraudulent activity.\n",
      "Market risk: As with any investment, Bitcoin values can fluctuate. Indeed, the currency's value has seen wild price swings over its short existence. Subject to high volume buying and selling on exchanges, it is highly sensitive to any news events related to it.\n",
      " Regulating Bitcoin As with any new technology, it has been difficult to regulate Bitcoin. The U.S. administration seeks to impose regulations on cryptocurrency but, at the same time, walks a tightrope in trying not to throttle a growing and economically beneficial industry.\n",
      " Enforcement agencies in the U.S. continue to rely on existing securities, commodities, and tax laws, but as of December 2024, no attempts from legislators have gained much attention from the country's law-making bodies.\n",
      " The European Commission's long-anticipated Markets in Crypto Assets legislation came into force in 2023, setting the stage for cryptocurrency regulations in the European Union.\n",
      " India banned several exchanges in December 2023 and continues to push back reviews of any legislation regarding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n",
      " What Exactly Is Bitcoin and How Does It Work?\n",
      "Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency. It uses blockchain, which is a distributed ledger secured by cryptographic techniques.\n",
      " What Happens If You Invest $100 in Bitcoin Today?\n",
      "Investing in Bitcoin is very risky, but there is also the possibility of high returns. Prices can move by thousands of dollars per day, and long-term outlooks for the cryptocurrency vary.\n",
      " Can You Convert Bitcoin Into Cash?\n",
      "Yes. Bitcoin is a convertible currency that can be exchanged for most fiat currencies.\n",
      " How Much Is $1 Bitcoin in US Dollars?\n",
      "An amount of Bitcoin worth $1 is worth $1 in U.S. dollars. The value of 1 BTC in U.S. dollars varies by the minute, but on Dec. 5, 2024, it was more than $100,000.\n",
      " The Bottom Line Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency introduced to the public and was intended to be used as a form of payment outside of legal tender. Since its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin's popularity has surged, and its blockchain uses have expanded.\n",
      " Though the process of generating Bitcoin is complex, investing in it is more straightforward. Investors and speculators can buy and sell Bitcoin on crypto exchanges. As with any investment, particularly one as new and volatile as Bitcoin, investors should carefully consider if Bitcoin is the right investment for them.\n",

      "Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that operates on a peer-to-peer network. It was created by an unknown person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, and each bitcoin is divisible up to eight decimal places. Bitcoin can be used for everyday transactions, as a store of value, or for investment. The total supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins. Bitcoin mining is the process of verifying transactions on the blockchain and miners are rewarded with Bitcoin and transaction fees. Bitcoin has influenced global finance and inspired many other digital currencies.\n",

      " What Is a Trading Strategy? A trading strategy is a systematic methodology used for buying and selling in the securities markets. A trading strategy is based on predefined rules and criteria used when making trading decisions.\n",
      " A trading strategy may be simple or complex, and involve considerations such as investment style (e.g., value vs. growth), market cap, technical indicators, fundamental analysis, industry sector, level of portfolio diversification, time horizon or holding period, risk tolerance, leverage, tax considerations, and so on. The key is that a trading strategy be set using objective data and analysis and is adhered to diligently. At the same time, a trading strategy should be periodically re-evaluated and tweaked as market conditions or individual goals change.\n",
      " Key Takeaways\n",
      "A trading strategy can be likened to a trading plan that takes into account various factors and requirements for an investor.A trading strategy typically consists of three stages: planning, placing trades, and executing trades.At each stage of the process, metrics relating to the strategy are measured and changed based on the change in markets.Most trading strategies are based on either technicals or fundamentals, using quantifiable information that can be backtested to determine accuracy. \n",
      " Understanding Trading Strategies A trading strategy includes a well-considered investing and trading plan that specifies investing objectives, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax implications. Ideas and best practices need to be researched and adopted then adhered to. Planning for trading includes developing methods that include buying or selling stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other investments and may extend to more complex trades such as options or futures.\n",
      " Placing trades means working with a broker or broker-dealer and identifying and managing trading costs including spreads, commissions, and fees. Once executed, trading positions are monitored and managed, including adjusting or closing them as needed. Risk and return are measured as well as portfolio impacts of trades and tax implications.\n",
      " Important\n",
      "The longer-term tax results of trading are a major factor and may encompass capital gains or tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains with losses.\n",
      " Developing a Trading Strategy There are many types of trading strategies, but they are based largely on either technicals or fundamentals. The common thread is that both rely on quantifiable information that can be backtested for accuracy. Technical trading strategies rely on technical indicators to generate trading signals. Technical traders believe all information about a given security is contained in its price and that it moves in trends. For example, a simple trading strategy may be a moving average crossover whereby a short-term moving average crosses above or below a long-term moving average.\n",
      " Fundamental trading strategies take fundamental factors into account. For instance, an investor may have a set of screening criteria to generate a list of opportunities. These criteria are developed by analyzing factors such as revenue growth and profitability.\n",
      " There is a third type of trading strategy that has gained prominence in recent times. A quantitative trading strategy is similar to technical trading in that it uses information relating to the stock to arrive at a purchase or sale decision. However, the matrix of factors that it takes into account to arrive at a purchase or sale decision is considerably larger compared to technical analysis. A quantitative trader uses several data points—regression analysis of trading ratios, technical data, price—to exploit inefficiencies in the market and conduct quick trades using technology.\n",
      " Special Considerations Trading strategies are employed to avoid behavioral finance biases and ensure consistent results. For example, traders following rules governing when to exit a trade would be less likely to succumb to the disposition effect, which causes investors to hold on to stocks that have lost value and sell those that rise in value. Trading strategies can be stress-tested under varying market conditions to measure consistency.\n",
      " Profitable trading strategies are difficult to develop, however, and there is a risk of becoming over-reliant on a strategy. For instance, a trader may curve fit a trading strategy to specific backtesting data, which may engender false confidence. The strategy may have worked well in theory based on past market data, but past performance does not guarantee future success in real-time market conditions, which may vary significantly from the test period.\n",
